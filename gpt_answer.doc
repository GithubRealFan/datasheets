I'll help you understand micro SAR (Synthetic Aperture Radar) signal processing and the differences between FMCW SAR and pulse-Doppler SAR systems.
Micro SAR Signal Processing Algorithm
Core SAR Processing Steps:

Raw Data Acquisition - Collect radar echoes while the platform moves
Range Compression - Matched filtering in range direction (fast-time)
Range Cell Migration Correction (RCMC) - Compensate for target trajectory
Azimuth Compression - Matched filtering in azimuth direction (slow-time)
Phase Correction - Motion compensation and atmospheric corrections
Image Formation - Final SAR image generation

Common Algorithms:

Range-Doppler Algorithm (RDA) - Most common, efficient
Chirp Scaling Algorithm (CSA) - Better for wide swaths
Back-Projection Algorithm - Most accurate but computationally intensive
Omega-K Algorithm - Frequency domain processing

Device Structure
Typical Micro SAR Components:

RF Front-End: Transmitter, receiver, antenna array
Signal Generator: Chirp/pulse generation
ADC/DAC: High-speed data conversion
Processing Unit: FPGA/GPU for real-time processing
Motion Sensors: IMU for motion compensation
Storage: High-speed data recording

FMCW SAR vs Pulse-Doppler SAR
FMCW SAR (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave):

Transmits continuous chirped signal
Lower peak power, higher average power
Better for short-range applications
Simpler hardware, lower cost
Range-velocity ambiguity can be an issue
Excellent range resolution
Common in miniaturized/micro SAR systems

Pulse-Doppler SAR (Impulse/Pulsed):

Transmits short pulses with high peak power
Higher peak power, lower duty cycle
Better for long-range applications
More complex but traditional approach
Better isolation between TX/RX
Used in most spaceborne/airborne SAR systems
Pulse Repetition Frequency (PRF) determines azimuth sampling

Key Differences: FMCW SAR vs Pulse-Doppler SAR
FMCW SAR (Frequency Modulated Continuous Wave)
Waveform Characteristics:

Continuous transmission of chirped signals
FMCW radar has advantages in cost, peak power, and minimum detectable range compared to pulse radar researchgate
FMCW radar mode is for short range measurement with bandwidths around 10 MHz ieee

Advantages:

Lower cost hardware
Reduced peak power requirements (safer, less complex)
Better for short-range applications (50-100m typical)
Simpler RF front-end design
No blind range issues
Excellent for miniaturized/micro SAR systems

Challenges:

FMCW operation violates the stop-and-go assumption commonly used for pulsed radar systems and introduces additional Doppler shifts to the spectrum and range profiles as well as range defocusing nih
TX/RX isolation required (leakage issues)
Ghost echoes appear where echo power from one range gate is distributed over neighboring range gates sciencedirect
Movement of targets causes additional frequency shift which can make it difficult to measure distance mwrf
Limited dynamic range

Signal Processing:

Beat frequency analysis (difference between TX and RX)
Frequency domain processing primary
Requires dechirping/stretch processing
Additional motion compensation needed

Pulse-Doppler SAR (Impulse/Pulsed)
Waveform Characteristics:

Short high-power pulses transmitted
PD radar mode is for long range target detection with bandwidths around 1 MHz and pulse widths of 4 microseconds ieee
Pulse Doppler radar systems are better suited for long-range detection sciencedirect

Advantages:

Pulse Doppler radar has the advantage to detect small amplitude moving target returns against a large amplitude cluttered background sciencedirect
Better TX/RX isolation (pulse timing separation)
Higher power per pulse → longer detection ranges
Exact range gate association
Traditional, well-established processing
Used in most spaceborne/airborne SAR

Challenges:

More complex hardware
Higher peak power requirements
Minimum range limitations (blind zone during TX)
Higher cost
More power consumption

Signal Processing:

Time-domain pulse compression (matched filtering)
Range processing: correlate with transmitted chirp
Doppler processing: coherent phase measurement across pulses
Stop-and-go assumption valid
